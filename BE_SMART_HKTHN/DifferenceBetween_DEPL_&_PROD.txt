Running PM2 in production vs on localhost is mostly about environment and deployment context, not a different PM2 program.

✅ Localhost vs Production — Meaning
Environment	Typical Use	Domain	Data/DB	PM2 Purpose
Localhost / Development	Testing, debugging during development	Runs on localhost (often 3000, 5173, etc.)	Uses local DB or mock services	Auto-restart, easier debugging
Production	Live app serving real users	Public server domain	Uses production database/services	High availability, logging, crash recovery

Same app, but behavior differs based on NODE_ENV, logging, resources, and where it is hosted.

✅ How PM2 knows the environment

PM2 uses NODE_ENV environment variable:

NODE_ENV=development → dev mode

NODE_ENV=production → optimized mode

Example:

pm2 start server.js --name "myapp" --env development

pm2 start server.js --name "myapp" --env production

✅ Check which mode (environment) PM2 is running in
pm2 env 0


(0 = process index)
or list all:

pm2 list
pm2 show myapp


You’ll see something like:

env = production
status = online


You can also check by inspecting the environment variables:

pm2 describe myapp


Look for:

NODE_ENV: production

✅ Typical workflow
🧪 Development (localhost)

Running on personal machine

Frequent restarts / reloads

Interactive debugging

Example:

pm2 start server.js --watch --env development


--watch auto-reloads on file changes
(never use in production)

🚀 Production (server)

App runs in background forever

Restart on crash or reboot

Logging & monitoring

Example:

pm2 start server.js --name "myapp" --env production
pm2 startup
pm2 save


This makes PM2 restart automatically on system reboot.

✅ Recap
Action	Development	Production
Start app	pm2 start app.js --env development	pm2 start app.js --env production
View logs	pm2 logs	pm2 logs myapp
Check env	pm2 env 0	pm2 env 0
Auto-restart on boot	(usually no)	pm2 startup && pm2 save

If you'd like, tell me:

✅ Your app (Node? Next? Nuxt? Express?)
✅ Where you're deploying (VPS? AWS? DigitalOcean?)
✅ Domain + SSL setup status

…and I can give you the exact PM2 commands to run in your scenario.
